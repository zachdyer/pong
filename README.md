# Pong - Forever Alone Addition
This is an HTML5 game that is like pong except single player. The longer you bounce the ball the higher your score will be. See if you can hack the game to get a killer score. 

## Instructions
Press any button to start. Press the left mouse button to launch the ball. Move the mouse left or right to bounce the ball back to the walls.

### iPhone Users
If you have an iPhone you can play this game as a web app. In safari go to http://zachdyer.github.io/pong/ then tap options and tap *add to home screen*. This will place an icon on your home screen and it will be treated just like an app. Open the app tap the screen to start and slide your finger to move the paddle where you want the paddle to go.

##Android Support
I don't have an android device to test with so I haven't done any android support. However if you want to help contribute to Android support feel free to fork. :)
